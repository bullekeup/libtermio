TODO list for MS4L project

Network configuration:
 -> Retrieve from file
 -> Get existing config (veth pairs, etc...)
    -> If our config already exists
        -> If no other msldaemon is running, delete all and re-create

CoAP client in daemon:
  -> Finish token generation and message tracking in resp_hdlr()
  
CoAP root server - fakeinit:
  -> Implement abilities in nodes
  -> Implement services (a service dir containing each service as a subdir)
  -> Implement service redeploying / storage (tar.lzo archives)
    -> Handle block transfers in CoAP
    -> Ability to compress and send an archive (using hash as indication of successfull transfer).
    -> If node hasn't storage ability set, don't keep archive.

Coding convention refactoring:
  -> static methods begin with _<submodule>, ex : _coapclt
  -> exported methods begin with _<module>_<submodule> ex : _dmn_coapclt
